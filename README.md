# WBot2.0
### Specialized Discord Bot

## What this is
This is a Discord bot written in C#, leveraging the help of the DSharpPlus library.
It's my humble (and possibly terrible) attempt at using Dependency Injection, Hosting and Reflection.

## What this isn't
Probably, for you. This bot client is set up for a specific server. You're free to use it as a base (wouldn't recommend), 
but cloning it and trying to run it as-is is most likely not going to work for you.

## Who is responsible for this mess?
Mostly me, but probably wouldn't have gone far if it weren't for [Matt Jeanes](https://github.com/MattJeanes),
as this is heavily based on (by which I mean, copied and adapted from) his [Discord bot template](https://github.com/MattJeanes/DiscordBot).
Slowly I'll be trying to replace his code with my own so as not to just rip from his base.
